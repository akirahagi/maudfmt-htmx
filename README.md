## IDE Setup

### vim - conform.nvim

```lua
require("conform").setup({
  formatters = {
    maudfmt = {
      command = "maudfmt",
      args = { "-s" },  -- add any config you wish
    },
  },
  formatters_by_ft = {
    rust = { "rustfmt", "maudfmt" },
  },
})
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Skip formatting for a macro

There are several reasons you might not want a specific macro block to be formatted:

- You'd like to keep the macro block as a one liner _(might be supported in the future)_
- You'd like to format it yourself
- `maudfmt` is broken and you'd like to keep the format in check while the issue is investigated.

To do so, just add the `rustfmt::skip` attribute to the macro block.

```
#[rustfmt::skip]
html! {
p {
  "my personal formatting"
  }
}
```

### Skip formatting for a single line

To skip formatting for just one line, add a `// maudfmt-ignore` comment on the line before:

```
html! {
    p { "formatted" }
    // maudfmt-ignore
    span class="unformatted"   id="test" { "content" }
    h1 { "also formatted" }
}
```

### Magic comments

_maudfmt_ automatically manages exanding and collapsing blocks depending on line length.

In some cases, would might prefer to expand a block even if it fits on a single line.
To do this, you can use _magic comments_:

- on the opening bracket line:

```
p { //
   "Small text"
}
```

- inside the block itself

```
p {
   // either on an empty line
   "Small text" // or as a trailing comment
}
```

> doesn't matter if there is an actual comment, the `//` comment marker is enough.

## A note on non-doc comments

Currently this formatter does not support non-doc comments in code blocks (`Splices`).
It uses `prettyplease` for formatting rust code, and `prettyplease` does not support this.
This means that you _can_ use non-doc comments throughout your view macro, as long as they don't reside within code blocks.

> A bit more context: `prettyplease` uses `syn` to parse rust syntax. According to https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/comments.html#non-doc-comments
> non-doc comments _are interpreted as a form of whitespace_ by the parser; `syn` basically ignores/skips these comments and does not include them in the syntax tree.
